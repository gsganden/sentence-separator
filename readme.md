This Python script puts each sentence of a text document on a separate line, which is helpful for tracking changes with Git and other version-control systems.

It takes a path to an input file and a desired output path as command-line arguments.

The results may not be perfect, but the script does handle some edge cases such as "i.e.," "e.g.," ellipses, decimal numbers, and upper-case initials.
